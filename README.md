# Street Mapping
* A mapping program which can plot a map of a specific region by reading and storing a data set of roads and locations in an undirected weighted graph and find the shortest path by Dijkstra's algorithm.
* The 4th project of my CSC172 "Data Structures & Algorithms" course.
* Finished in December 2017.
